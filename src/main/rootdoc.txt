== Description ==
'''sbt-s3''' is a simple sbt plugin that can manipulate objects on Amazon S3.
== Usage ==
  - add to your project/plugin.sbt the line:
   {{{addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-s3" % "0.9")}}}
  - then add to your build.sbt the line:
   {{{s3Settings}}}
 
 You will then be able to use the tasks s3-upload, s3-download, s3-delete, and s3-generate-links, defined
 in the nested object com.typesafe.sbt.S3Plugin.S3 as upload, download, delete, and generateLinks respectively.
 All these operations will use HTTPS as a transport protocol.
 
 Please select the `S3Plugin` object, to the left, and then the nested `S3` object link, for a complete example
 and additional documentation of the available sbt tasks.
